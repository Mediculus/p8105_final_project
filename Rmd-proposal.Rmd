# Motivation
Fragility index has been suggested to be a simple metric of a trialsâ€™ robustness, which may pair well with other metrics like p-values. Our motivation for studying fragility index arises from our interest in how it differs based on different characteristics. Multiple prior journals have showed that it requires just a few patients to alter their outcomes. It is of concern to us that these studies require billions of dollars sunk but outcomes can be "easily" rendered obsolete based on so few participant outcomes. 

Our question of interest is whether fragility index is associated with a disease type. Specifically, we want to test the difference in fragility index for cancer related therapies to non-oncology immunologic monoclonal antibodies such as allergy, diabetes, and asthma. As a prior belief, we hypothesize that the median fragility Index of trials targeting cancers will be less than trials targeting auto-immune chronic diseases. 

# Intended Final Products
* Dataset of clinical trials with baseline information and our filtering strategy 
* Figures/graphs highlighting our data compared to previously published information 
* Statistical test comparing median fragility index based on different characteristics 
* Website that collates our findings with landing page, background, graphs, data, methods, and FI calculator. 

# Anticipated data sources  
* Search engines: Google Scholar, Pubmed, clinicaltrials.gov  
  * Review of ~25 trials with inclusion criterias of: 
    * Auto-immune disease-related phase 3 RCTs with a pairwise primary outcome, uses monoclonal antibody
    * Time period: 2007-2017  
    * Exclude trial designs with complicated trial design or mathematical methods 
    * Trials are published in a high impact journal e.g. NEJM, JAMA 
* After trials are selected, will scrape data from clinicaltrials.gov using its API to get csv format and use R for analysis


# Plan for Analysis/Visualization and Challenges

### Analysis 
* Data operation and outcome analysis:
  * Create R function to calculate the fragility index 
  * 2-sample analysis for statistical test the difference between oncology / non-oncology diseases with their respective fragility indexes 

### Visualization
* R ggplot or Plotly or Shiny?

### Potential Challenges
* Making FI calculator
* What interactions will be placed (Shiny)
* Obtaining enough high-quality data
* Creating FI function 

# Planned Timeline
* Data scraping and processing: ~7 days (11/9/2019)
* Data analysis, review, graphical construction: ~10 days
* Web building: ~4 days
* Debugging: all the time
